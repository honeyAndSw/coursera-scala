# Functional Programming in Scala

This repo is about the assignments of [Coursera scala specification](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala).   
I push them only to do version control, and to keep codes in remote.   
Happy Scala! :smile:

My accomplishments so far:   
* Functional Programming Principles in Scala (1 of 5)
